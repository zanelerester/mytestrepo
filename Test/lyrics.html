            (Verse 1)
            I've been looking for someone who's stronger than me,
            Who can take me where I belong.
            I've been dreaming of being someone special,
            A part of a bigger picture.

            (Chorus)
            Take on me, take on me,
            Let's dance to this tune,
            Let's make it ours,
            This is our story.

            (Verse 2)
            I've been feeling like a fool,
            But I know that I'm stronger than I thought.
            I've been fighting for what I believe in,
            And I'm proud of myself.

            (Chorus)
            Take on me, take on me,
            Let's dance to this tune,
            Let's make it ours,
            This is our story.
